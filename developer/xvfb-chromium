# This is a wrapper script that makes it possible to make Chromium work inside of a container. It is needed to run Jasmine tests using Karma.
#1. It launches the X virtual frame buffer (Xvfb) which emulates an X11 display so that the GUI code in the browser has a display to interact with.
#2. It launches Chromium and passes along any command line arguments to the browser process.
#3. It traps SIGTERM and relays the signal to the browser and Xvfb so that they will not continue to run once the test runner is finished.
